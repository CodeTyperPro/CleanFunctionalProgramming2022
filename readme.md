Clean - Functional Programming
----
## Reference repository for students (specially from ELTE)
---
`Hey there!` More than 150 were solved in this repository which was created to help students attending FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING courses. Here you can find exercises and source codes related to the following topics:

- Function definitions, guards, recursive functions, elementary types 
- Syntax, reduction steps, redex, normal form 
- Lazy and eager evaluation 
- Standard functions, types, predefined operators 
- Data structures in FP - lists, tuple, record, array, class 
- Lists, definitions, operations and functions on lists, generators, patterns, recursion 
- Fibonacci function, double recursion
- Types in FP
- Simple types, algebraic types, composite types, trees 
- Algorithms
- search, sort, traverse -higher order functions, filters, map, iterate, fold
- Tuples, list comprehensions, equivalences
- Sorting algorithms, merging
- Infinite lists -records, arrays
- Algebraic types, trees
- Abstract data types (ADT)
- Classes, instances, type classes
<!--- - FP applications.  --->

Please, feel free to explore the solutions. Some may be obvious and other can be really challenging! So, enjoy the repo :) I created for you (HARDWORKING STUDENT) ...

SIDE NOTE: In case you would like to report anything, you can reach me on social medias!
