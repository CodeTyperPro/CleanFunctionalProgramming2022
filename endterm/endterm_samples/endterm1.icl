-- Students' regulation of Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.)
-- states that as long as a student presents another studentâ€™s work -
-- or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance,
-- it will count as a disciplinary fault.

-- The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal
-- of the student from the University.

/* Record Student. (10 points)
*
* Create an Algebraic type `StudyLevel` which can have
* 3 values: `BSc`, `MSc`, `PhD`.
* Create a record `Student` which has 3 fields:
* * id - A string id
* * level - A study level with type `StudyLevel`
* * grades - A list of grades, where each grade is an integer
* Write a `getBestBScStudent` function that takes a list of students
* and returns a string ID of the student who has highest average grade
* among BSc students. Assume that the list contains at least one BSc student.
* If multiple students have same maximum average return any of their IDs.
